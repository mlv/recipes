## The Bazwich    
(A sandwich *not* for the masses.)

Ingredients, heavily UK-biased: (with rest-of-the-world explanations parenthesised):

* White bread, preferably Warburton's medium sliced;
* Butter, or equivalent low-calorie spread;
* Peanut butter, crunchy;
* Jelly;
* Cheddar cheese;
* Kit-Kat (chocolate coated wafer biscuit);
* Some weird UK yeast spread called Marmite (yeast spread, better than Vegemite);
* Canned ham, the firm stuff, not too-heavily processed.
* The more adventurous soul may wish to add lazy garlic, but thinly.

Method:

* Spread the spreadable stuff on alternating slices of bread,
* Place the non-spreadable stuff on one slice and cover with the other,
* Slice in half... side- or length-ways, or even diagonally if you're so inclined,
* Place on a plate with potato chips,
* Eat!
